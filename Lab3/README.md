The purpose of this program is to take data from the Spotify Top 200 charts and process it into something that can be used by other departments in the record label company 
including the executive.

We need this program to simplify the data from the CSV file because looking at just the CSV file is very difficult and makes it very hard to sort out useful information. That is 
why this project is made, to make that part easier for those that require the information in a more use friendly format.

This lab is very similar to Lab2 but in this lab we use LinkedList to create the report for the executive.
