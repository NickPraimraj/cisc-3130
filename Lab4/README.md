In this lab we had to give our VIP the list of songs that appeared in the fiscal quarter in ascending order.
To do this we had a choice of doing it via stacks/queues or a combination of both. I opted for stacks and
sorted the stack using a temporaray stack.

To use this program you need all 12 weeks in a folder on your desktop (you will need to change the names and
such so it reads down the right path).

To understand the sorting for a stack I used these 2 videos and links in their description.
