### How this program works:

For this lab we had to make a calculator that would calculate our grade
for the semester. The items used in the grade calculation are the
pratice problem grade (max 44), the lab grade (max 16), midterm grade 
(max 20) and the final exam grade (max 20). This program handles the
exception of entering a number that is larger than the max values and
will give your grade as a letter with the number range corresponding to
that letter grade.
